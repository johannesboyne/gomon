./gomon
=======

It is a bit like [nodemon](http://remy.github.io/nodemon/) just for GO or [Alex' Golang Automatic Reloads](http://www.alexedwards.net/blog/golang-automatic-reloads). And I only quickly wrote it for myself but it is very simple and you are **invited** to improve this little helper!

It sets the `$GOPATH` for you and you can install it via `npm install -g go-mon` (or like a pro `npm i -g go-mon`).

Then just run a go programm like `gomon staticsmoothie.go`!
